# WebScraper

Purpose of this code is to obtain NBA Player Stats: Totals from www.basketball-reference.com using a static web scraper. Specific seasons are obtained by providing the year the NBA season ended in. 
Ex: If looking for the 2020-2021 season you would provide 2021 as the first input.

The first outcome is a pandas dataframe for further analysis and the second optional outcome is a copy of the dataframe and its columns in two separate text files.
